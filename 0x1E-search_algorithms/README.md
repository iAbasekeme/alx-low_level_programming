This directory i will be practicing search algorithms and at the end of this project i am expected to explain the following:

What is a search algorithm
What is a linear search
What is a binary search
What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

I will also be coding according to the following space complexities:
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
